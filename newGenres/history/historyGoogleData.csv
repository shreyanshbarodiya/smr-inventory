9788125036845,"History of Modern India presents an authoritative overview of the history of what was known as British India. The text is largely based on the author s research on nationalism and colonialism in India and also draws from the works of eminent historians of the period. Challenging and revising colonial and nationalist interpretations of history, this book moves away from a largely political narrative to a social, economic and religious history of modern India. It explains how conditions in India during the eighteenth century helped the British East India Company establish its rule in India. It also gives us important insights into the primary aim of colonial rule which was the economic exploitation of India through trade and investment. The topics are arranged thematically in order to showcase the various forces that went into the making of independent India. However, in the entire arrangement of themes, the chronology of the period is enmeshed innovatively with the various forces that evolved both as a cause and effect of British imperialist rule of the subcontinent. The book also provides a detailed account of the nationalist movement and introduces us to the contributions of different individuals who were behind the nationalist movement. A comprehensive textbook for students of history and interested readers, History of Modern India is essential reading for a broad based understanding of the making of modern India."

In this lively, informative and insightful work, the award-winning author and parliamentarian brilliantly demonstrates how Indian diplomacy has become sprightlier since then and where it needs to focus in the 21st century. Explaining why foreign policy matters to an India focused on its own domestic transformation, Tharoor surveys the country's major international relationships, evokes its soft power and global responsibilities, analyses the workings of the Ministry of External Affairs and parliament and assesses the impact of public opinion on government policy. Indeed, Tharoor presents his ideas about a contemporary new grand strategy for the nation, arguing that India must move beyond non-alignment to multi-alignment. This book sets out a clear vision of an India now ready to assume global responsibility in the contemporary world. Pax Indica is another substantial achievement from one of our finest Indian authors."

9780143068648,"The Indian subcontinent was the scene of dramatic upheavals a few thousand years ago. The Northwest region entered an arid phase, and erosion coupled with tectonic events played havoc with river courses. One of them disappeared. Celebrated as Sarasvati in the Rig Veda and the Mahabharata, this river was rediscovered in the early nineteenth century through topographic explorations by British officials. Recently, geological and climatological studies have probed its evolution and disappearance, while satellite imagery has traced the river s buried courses and isotope analyses have dated ancient waters still stored under the Thar Desert. In the same Northwest, the subcontinent s first urban society the Indus civilization flourished and declined. But it was not watered by the Indus alone: since Aurel Stein s expedition in the 1940s, hundreds of Harappan sites have been identified in the now dry Sarasvati s basin. The rich Harappan legacy in technologies, arts and culture sowed the seeds of Indian civilization as we know it now. Drawing from recent research in a wide range of disciplines, this book discusses differing viewpoints and proposes a harmonious synthesis a fascinating tale of exploration that brings to life the vital role the lost river of the Indian desert played before its waters gurgled to a stop."

This made it incumbent upon me to omit certain vital facts, Malgonkar writes in the introduction , such as, for instance, Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar's secret assurance to Mr L B Bhopatkar, that his client, Mr V D Savarkar, had been implicated as a murder suspect on the flimsiest ground. The excised portions, along with rare photographs and documents from the National Archives are included in this 11th edition. This book is a reprint of the 1978 original, timed for the 60th anniversary of the event, with some additions in the form of rare photographs and documents unearthed by the publishers and not the author Manohar Malgonkar, now 95 and a virtual recluse. His account of the conspiracy, 30 years after the event, was a landmark effort that cemented his reputation as a historian. Of the six conspirators, Nathuram Godse, who fired the shot heard around the world, and Narayan Apte, who was by his side, were hanged. The other four were: Digambar Badge, who turned approver; Vishnu Karkare; Gopal Godse, Nathurams younger brother; and Madanlal Pahwa. Malgonkar met them after they had served their life sentences and they spoke to him at great length. All four provided information they had not revealed before and Malgonkar produced perhaps the most complete account of the plot to assassinate Gandhi."
