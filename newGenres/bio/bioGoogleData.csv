I had lunch with a group of research students and went back to class. As I was returning to my rooms in the evening the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you ...' Some months earlier, I had left my post as principal scientific adviser to the government of India, a Cabinet-level post, to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change. Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off. It brings together details from his career and presidency that are not generally known as he speaks out for the first time on certain points of controversy. It offers insight not only into an extraordinary personality but also a vision of how a country with a great heritage can become great in accomplishment, skills and abilities through effort, perseverance and confidence. It is a continuing saga, above all, of a journey, individual and collective, that will take India to 2020 and beyond as a developed nation."

9780140446036,"An Extraordinary Detailed Manual On Statecraft And The Science Of Living By One Of Classical India'S Greatest Minds, Kautilya, Also Known As Chanakya And Vishnugupta, Wrote The Arthashastra Not Later Than 150 Ad Though The Date Has Not Been Conclusively Established. Legend Has It That He Was Either A Brahmin From Kerala Or From North India; However, It Is Certain That Kautilya Was The Man Who Destroyed The Nanda Dynasty And Installed Chandragupta Maurya As The King Of Magadha. A Master Strategist Who Was Well-Versed In The Vedas And Adept At Creating Intrigues And Devising Political Stratagems, Kautilya'S Genius Is Reflected In His Arthashastra Which Is The Most Comprehensive Treatise Of Statecraft Of Classical Times. The Text Contains Fifteen Books Which Cover Numerous Topics Viz., The King; A Complete Code Of Law; Foreign Policy; Secret And Occult Practices And So On. The Arthashastra Is Written Mainly In Prose But Also Incorporates 380 Shlokas. Artha, Literally Wealth, Is One Of Four Supreme Aims Prescribed By Hindu Tradition. However, It Has A Much Wider Significance And The Material Well-Being Of Individuals Is Just A Part Of It. In Accordance With This, Kautilya'S Arthashastra Maintains That The State Or Government Of A Country Has A Vital Role To Play In Maintaining The Material Status Of Both The Nation And Its People. Therefore, A Significant Part Of The Arthashastra Has To Do With The Science Of Economics. When It Deals With The Science Of Politics, The Arthashastra Describes In Detail The Art Of Government In Its Widest Sense The Maintenance Of Law And Order As Also Of An Efficient Administrative Machinery."

Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy? When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didnt have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams, wasnt about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living. In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come."

The statistics, although an improvement on previous decades, are certainly not in women's favour - of 197 heads of state, only twenty-two are women. Women hold just 20 percent of seats in parliaments globally, and in the world of big business, a meagre eighteen of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women. In Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg - Facebook COO and one of Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women in Business - looks at what women can do to help themselves, and make the small changes in their life that can effect change on a more universal scale. She draws on her own experiences working in some of the world's most successful businesses, as well as academic research, to find practical answers to the problems facing women in the workplace. Learning to 'lean in' is about tackling the anxieties and preconceptions that stop women reaching the top - taking a place at the table, and making yourself a part of the debate."

An artist, safecracker, practical joker and storyteller, Feynman's life was a series of combustible combinations made possible by his unique mixture of high intelligence, unquenchable curiosity and eternal scepticism. Over a period of years, Feynman's conversations with his friend Ralph Leighton were first taped and then set down as they appear here, little changed from their spoken form, giving a wise, funny, passionate and totally honest self-portrait of one of the greatest men of our age."

When her identity was discovered, Malala began to appear in both Pakistani and international media, advocating the freedom to pursue education for all.
