As chief of the country's defence research and development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the story of Kalam's rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the story of Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag-missiles that have become household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile power of international reckoning. This is also the saga of independent India's struggle for technological self-sufficiency and defensive autonomy-a story as much about politics, domestic and international, as it is about science."

As I was returning to my rooms in the evening the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you ...' Some months earlier, I had left my post as principal scientific adviser to the government of India, a Cabinet-level post, to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change. Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off.

9780140446036,L.N. Rangarajan,Politics,History,Cultural,"The Arthashastra is an ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, economic policy and military strategy, written in Sanskrit. It identifies its author by the names 'Kauṭilya' and 'Vishnugupta', both names that are traditionally identified with Chanakya (c. 350–283 BC), who was a scholar at Takshashila and the teacher and guardian of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Mauryan Empire. The text was influential until the 12th century, when it disappeared. It was rediscovered in 1904 by R. Shamasastry, who published it in 1909. The first English translation was published in 1915.Roger Boesche describes the Arthaśāstra as ""a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good.""Centrally, Arthaśāstra argues how in an autocracy an efficient and solid economy can be managed. It discusses the ethics of economics and the duties and obligations of a king. The scope of Arthaśāstra is, however, far wider than statecraft, and it offers an outline of the entire legal and bureaucratic framework for administering a kingdom, with a wealth of descriptive cultural detail on topics such as mineralogy, mining and metals, agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine and the use of wildlife. The Arthaśāstra also focuses on issues of welfare (for instance, redistribution of wealth during a famine) and the collective ethics that hold a society together."

I simply want to tell the story of my numerous experiments with truth, and as my life consists of nothing but those experiments, it is true that the story will take the shape of an autobiography....Identification with everything that lives is impossible without self-purification; without self-purification, the observance of the law of Ahimsa must remain an empty dream; God can never be realised by one who is not pure of heart. Self-purification, therefore, must remain purification in all walks of life. And purification being highly infectious, purification of oneself necessarily leads to the purification of one's surroundings.But the path to self-purification is hard and steep. To attain perfect purity, one has to become absolutely passion-free in thought, speech and action; to rise above the opposing currents of love and hatred, attachment and repulsion. I know that I have not in me as yet the triple purity, in spite of constant ceaseless striving for it. That is why the world's praise fails to move me; indeed it very often stings me. To conquer the subtle passions seems to me far harder than the physical conquest of the world by the force of arms. Ever since my return to India, I have had experiences of the dormant passions lying hidden within me. The knowledge of them has made me feel humiliated though not defeated. The experiences and experiments have sustained me and given me great joy. But I know I still have before me a difficult path to traverse. I must reduce myself to zero. So long as a man does not of his own free will put himself last among his fellow creatures, there is no salvation for him. Ahimsa is the farthest limit of humility.Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi,26 November, 1925."

Fiercely independent (read the chapter entitled ""Judging Books by Their Covers""), intolerant of stupidity even when it comes packaged as high intellectualism (check out ""Is Electricity Fire?""), unafraid to offend (see ""You Just Ask Them?""), Feynman informs by entertaining. It's possible to enjoy Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman, a bestseller ever since its initial publication in 1985, simply as a bunch of hilarious yarns with the author as know-it-all hero. At some point, however, attentive readers realise that underneath all the merriment simmers a running commentary on what constitutes authentic knowledge: learning by understanding, not by rote; refusal to give up on seemingly insoluble problems, and total disrespect for fancy ideas that have no grounding in the real world.

9788190620826,Benjamin Franklin,Biography,History,Nonfiction,"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is the traditional name for the unfinished record of his own life written by Benjamin Franklin from 1771 to 1790. Franklin himself appears to have called the work his Memoirs. Altho it had a tortuous publication history after his death, this work has become one of the most famous & influential autobiographies ever written. Franklin's account of his life is divided into four parts, reflecting the different periods at which he wrote them. There are actual breaks in the narrative between the 1st three parts, but Part 3's narrative continues into Part 4 without an authorial break only an editorial one. The Autobiography remained unpublished during Franklin's lifetime. In 1791, a 1st edition appeared, in French rather than English, as Mémoires de la vie privée de Benjamin Franklin, published in Paris. This translation of Part 1 only was based on a flawed transcript made of hi manuscript before he'd revised it. This French translation was then retranslated into English in two London publications of 1793. One of the London editions served as a basis for a retranslation into French in 1798 in an edition which also included a fragment of Part 2. The 1st three parts of the Autobiography were 1st published together (in English) by Franklin's grandson, Wm Temple Franklin, in London in 1818, in Vol 1 of Memoirs of the Life & Writings of Benjamin Franklin. W.T. Franklin didn't include Part 4 because he had previously traded away the original holograph of the Autobiography for a copy that contained only the 1st three parts. Furthermore, he felt free to make unauthoritative stylistic revisions to his grandfather's autobiography, & on occasion followed the translated & retranslated versions mentioned above rather than Franklin's original text. W.T. Franklin's text was the standard version of the Autobiography for 50 years, until John Bigelow purchased the original manuscript in France & in 1868 published the most reliable text that had yet appeared, including the 1st English publication of Part 4. In the 20th century, important editions by Max Ferrand & the staff of the Huntington Library in San Marino, CA (Benjamin Franklin's Memoirs: Parallel Text Edition, 1949) & by Leonard W. Labaree (1964, as part of the Yale University Press edition of The Papers of Benjamin Franklin) improved on Bigelow's accuracy. In 1981, J.A. Leo Lemay & P.M. Zall produced The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin: A Genetic Text, attempting to show all revisions & cancellations in the holograph manuscript. This, the most accurate edition of all so far published, served as a basis for Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography: A Norton Critical Edition & for the text of this autobiography printed in the Library of America's edition of Franklin's Writings"
