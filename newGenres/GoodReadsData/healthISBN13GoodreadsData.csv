9781847393890,Sharon Mazel,Nonfiction,Parenting,Self Help,"Eighteen years after it first hit the shelves and having sold more than 10 million copies, What to Expect When You're Expecting is still on nearly every mother-to-be's reading list. This completely revised and updated edition is packed with answers to hundreds of questions and worries expectant parents may have. The information is presented in a month-by-month format starting with planning a pregnancy and choosing a practitioner, and follows through to six weeks after delivery. Each chapter begins with an explanation of what to expect at a particular month's prenatal visit and a brief description of how mom and baby are growing and changing before getting to the heart of the matter: What You May Be Concerned About. Topics are presented as questions ranging from ""Should I be taking vitamins?"" to ""What if I forget everything I learn in childbirth education class?"" to ""Will I be able to breastfeed?"" The answers are generally reassuring and provide enough information to soothe a worried mom between prenatal visits. Despite the reassuring answers, however, the sheer volume of worries discussed may alarm an otherwise calm mom-to-be.  The book also features a complete nutrition plan (though many women may find it difficult to follow), a special chapter just for expectant dads, and extensive information about dealing with minor illnesses, chronic conditions, and pregnancy complications. What to Expect has guided countless women through their pregnancies and makes an informative addition to the mainstream pregnancy and childbirth bookshelf. --Jennifer Lindsay"

Weiss,Nonfiction,Spirituality,Psychology,"In Many Lives Many Masters, Brian Weiss, a psychiatrist by profession, recounts his experiences from therapy sessions with a certain patient, and how they led to his gradual discovery of the concept of past-life regression.Dr. Weiss had been conducting therapy for a young patient named Catherine for about eighteen months. However, his traditional methods of therapy were proving to be futile in ridding her of chronic panic attacks and recurring nightmares.He then decided to take a different approach and switched to hypnosis to cure Catherine. Astonishingly, under the influence of hypnosis, Catherine began to recall past-life experiences that seemed to hold the answers to her traumatic problems.Dr. Weiss was initially skeptical about Catherine's response to hypnosis. However, his skepticism was shattered when the latter began channeling information from higher spiritual entities and started revealing many secrets about life and death. She also revealed several striking things about Weiss' life, including information about his family and his dead son. From then onwards, the lives of both the patient and the doctor were dramatically transformed.Dr. Weiss delved into public records to research, and confirmed the elements of Catherine's stories. Their veracity convinced him of the survival of a certain human element beyond the barrier of death. The case provided in-depth information about the continuation of life after death, the connection between past-life events and present-life behavior, and the many mysteries of the mind.This book is a result of his findings through the above case, and takes readers on a journey through hitherto unexplored concepts and beliefs.
