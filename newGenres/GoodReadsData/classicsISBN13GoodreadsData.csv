9780140446036,L.N. Rangarajan,Politics,History,Cultural,"The Arthashastra is an ancient Indian treatise on statecraft, economic policy and military strategy, written in Sanskrit. It identifies its author by the names 'Kauṭilya' and 'Vishnugupta', both names that are traditionally identified with Chanakya (c. 350–283 BC), who was a scholar at Takshashila and the teacher and guardian of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Mauryan Empire. The text was influential until the 12th century, when it disappeared. It was rediscovered in 1904 by R. Shamasastry, who published it in 1909. The first English translation was published in 1915.Roger Boesche describes the Arthaśāstra as ""a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good.""Centrally, Arthaśāstra argues how in an autocracy an efficient and solid economy can be managed. It discusses the ethics of economics and the duties and obligations of a king. The scope of Arthaśāstra is, however, far wider than statecraft, and it offers an outline of the entire legal and bureaucratic framework for administering a kingdom, with a wealth of descriptive cultural detail on topics such as mineralogy, mining and metals, agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine and the use of wildlife. The Arthaśāstra also focuses on issues of welfare (for instance, redistribution of wealth during a famine) and the collective ethics that hold a society together."

The period is the ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men, when the famous forest of Mirkwood was still standing, and the mountains were full of danger. In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way (as he did) - if you do not already know all about these things - much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves, and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period.""""For Mr. Bilbo Baggins visited various notable persons; conversed with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent; and was present, rather unwillingly, at the Battle of the Five Armies. This is all the more remarkable, since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend, perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement.

It explores the concept of totalitarianism and underlines Orwell’s opposition to the same.The novel is set in the fictional province of Oceania, one of the most powerful states in the world. It is a state ruled by The Party, a government that espouses totalitarianism. Under the leadership of a man named Big Brother, The Party tyrannizes the populace, defending its ideology as favouring the greater good. It is divided into fours ministries, which are used to control the people in various ways, from monitoring their public and private lives to reducing rationing, from manipulating information to countering dissension in torturous ways.The protagonist is a man named Winston Smith, who works for The Party in the Ministry of Truth. He has the job of manipulating newspaper articles to ensure that every piece of historical information is in alignment with his party’s ideologies. He secretly harbours the desire to rebel against The Party, a desire he acts upon by keeping a record of his dissenting views on the totalitarian government.His secret betrayal eventually comes to light, leaving his life at the mercy of The Party. His illicit affair with a young mechanic named Julia forms an important part of the plot.The novel highlights themes like nationalism, censorship, sexual repression, constant government surveillance, public mind control, oppression of individuality, all of which are highly applicable to the 21st century political scenario. Seen from the perspective of the modern world, the manner in which Orwell’s prophetic vision has come to life is highly convincing and disturbing.First published in 1949, its premise and principles have become increasingly relevant in modern times. The book has been adapted for film, theatre, music, radio, video games, comics, and other works of literature."

9781840220964,Friedrich Engels,Philosophy,Nonfiction,Politics,"A spectre is haunting Europe (and the world). Not, in the twenty-first century, the spectre of communism, but the spectre of capitalism. Marx's prediction that the state would wither away of its own accord has proved inaccurate, and he did not foresee the tyrannies which have ruled large parts of the globe in his name. Indeed, he would have been appalled if he had witnessed them. But his analysis of the evils and dangers of raw capitalism is as correct now as when it was written, and some of his suggestions (progressive income tax, abolition of child labour, free education for all children) are now accepted with little question. In a world where capitalism is no longer held in check by fear of a communist alternative, The Communist Manifesto (with Socialism Utopian and Scientific, Engels's brief and clear exposition of Marxist thought) is essential reading. The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 is Engels's first, and probably best-known, book. With Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor, it was and is the outstanding study of the working class in Victorian England."

9780553213454,John Tenniel,Classics,Fantasy,Fiction,"In 1862 Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a shy Oxford mathematician with a stammer, created a story about a little girl tumbling down a rabbit hole. Thus began the immortal adventures of Alice, perhaps the most popular heroine in English literature. Countless scholars have tried to define the charm of the Alice books–with those wonderfully eccentric characters the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum, and Tweedledee, the Cheshire Cat, Mock Turtle, the Mad Hatter et al.–by proclaiming that they really comprise a satire on language, a political allegory, a parody of Victorian children’s literature, even a reflection of contemporary ecclesiastical history. Perhaps, as Dodgson might have said, Alice is no more than a dream, a fairy tale about the trials and tribulations of growing up–or down, or all turned round–as seen through the expert eyes of a child."
9780141439716,Roger Pooley,Classics,Fiction,Christian,"In John Bunyan's hands, a pious tract is transformed into a work of imaginative literature, The Pilgrim's Progress, whose influence - both on work that followed and on the English consciousness as a whole - has been immeasurable. This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction and notes by Roger Pooley.John Bunyan began The Pilgrim's Progress while he was in prison for conducting unauthorised Baptist religious services outside of the Church of England. In this classic allegory, devout everyman Christian abandons his family and the City of Destruction and sets off to find salvation. His path is straight but not easy, and he is beset by trials, including the terrible violence of the destructive Apollyon and the Giant Despair, as he pursues his pilgrimage through the Slough of Despond, the Delectable Mountains and Vanity Fair towards the Celestial City. In the second part of the narrative his wife, Christiana, is escorted by Great-Heart through the same difficult terrain. Written with the urgency of a persecuted faith and a fiery imagination, The Pilgrim's Progress is a spiritual as well as a literary classic.In his introduction, Roger Pooley discusses Bunyan's life and theology, as well as the text's biblical and historical backdrop, its success and critical history. This edition also includes further reading, notes and accompanying seventeenth-century illustrations, a chronology, suggested further reading, notes and an index.John Bunyan (1628-88) was born in Elstow, a village near Bedford. Soon after the Restoration he was arrested for unlicensed preaching and, because he refused to stop, remained in prison in Bedford for twelve years. In 1678 he published the first part of The Pilgrim's Progress. It became an immediate bestseller, running through twelve editions and being translated into Dutch, French and Welsh during Bunyan's lifetime; since then it has been translated into more than two hundred languages.If you enjoyed The Pilgrim's Progress, you might like Julian of Norwich's Revelations of Divine Love, also available in Penguin Classics."
