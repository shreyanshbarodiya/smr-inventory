If you are copying these guys, you aren't learning from them. It's easier to copy a model than to make something new: doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. Every new creation goes from 0 to 1. This book is about how to get there. 'Peter Thiel has built multiple breakthrough companies, and Zero to One shows how.' ELON MUSK, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla 'This book delivers completely new and refreshing ideas on how to create value in the world.' MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO of Facebook 'When a risk taker writes a book, read it. In the case of Peter Thiel, read it twice. Or, to be safe, three times. This is a classic.' NASSIM NICHOLAS TALEB, author of The Black Swan"

If you have not read this fantastic masterpiece then you are missing a chance of a lifetime to turn everything around in your favor. If you consistently apply the techniques described in this book, life will have no choice but to give you what you wish. The information contained in this book is so powerful, I personally think that it should be taught as a class in every high school in the nation. Napoleon Hill spent 25 years of his life guided by Andrew Carnegie (The Richest Man in the World at the time) to discover these great secrets. Mr. Hill analyzed hundreds of well-known wealthy men, many of whom admitted that they had accumulated their vast fortunes through the aid of the Carnegie secret. Get your copy today, you will be glad you did."

In this bestselling critique of conventional wisdom, writer and Morgan Stanley investor Ruchir Sharma draws on two decades spent touring the globe to offer insights into the world's most interesting emerging markets. Sharma reveals his rules for spotting success stories and lays out a compelling argument for where the future will happen. A new chapter written for this paperback edition explains what this means for rich nations of the West and whether we may be about to see an American economic renaissance. 'Fascinating . . . Not only does he challenge the accepted wisdom - that China and India will motor on, ad infinitum - but he comes up with some surprising candidates for the next decade's economic stars.' Sunday Times 'The most interesting book on the new economic landscape that I have read in years.' Fareed Zakaria 'There is no better book for country-by-country accounts of emerging markets.' Times of India 'This is a great road-map to the new and better-balanced world in which we will all live.' Independent 'An investor's lonely planet guide to the world for the new century.' Bloomberg 'Combines keen on-the-ground reporting and economic and investment analysis with lively, lucid prose.' Forbes"
